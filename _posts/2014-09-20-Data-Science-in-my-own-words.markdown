I am not an expert in data science, but I met lot of people who did exiting work in this field. I attended fifth elephant twice. I travelled quite a bit and did some work on my own with team of people who call themselves as IOT ( Internet of things ). The main aim of this IOT team is to build a complete big data package which can be used by normal people. The most interesting package that I found in IOT is understanding patterns in crime to give alerts to police. There is bigger hype around which I think will turn in to reality in about 10 to 15 years . Big data is getting bigger, and there is an opportunity to connect many things together than we could even imagine. It’s always easy to visualize data as it is. But, difficulty comes in linking them in solving a problem and innovating to the extend that other’s wouldn’t even think of such idea. As I moved on and talked to few more people, I found out that market is no longer interested in analytics. Big companies already made their mark in the field of analytics. So, people are trying to catch this new fish called predictive analytics. In the process, I met with few fake people who call themselves as data scientists who know few catch terms called big data, data science. Real data scientists use terms like machine learning, models, statistics, probability.

Moving on, I would like to mention about evil data science. This is actually for users. Internet is no longer safe. All the free stuff you find on internet and the amount of desperation in getting new users means a lot more danger to your personal life than you and I could imagine. User’s should keep in mind that their data will be used.

I met a guy called AdhiNarayan . He describes big data in terms of people. He describes human senses as sensors. We have limitations in using sensors to get data from the world. But, human beings have sensors which can do powerful things. We have big data embed deep in to our lives that we take our own ability to observe patterns to be natural. We see things when we walk on a rainy day. What do we observe? Is it just a rain? Is it millions of molecules? Or is it the whole cycle of life?

It’s all beautiful. Is there a limit? no

The limitations of big data is limitation of human thinking. With the amount of positivity and people contributing, I think It will reach wonderful heights in the coming years.
