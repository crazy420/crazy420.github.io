It's funny. I am studying in 3rd year of my bachelors degree. I spent 3 years of my life without making any sense out of it. I spent most of my time in classes. Classes are very Frustrating and teachers are very dominating.

 Why should I read their version of science and technology. I could just go to library and read a book. Once I started getting these thoughts in my mind, I started questioning teachers about why they are teaching all these subjects to us. Most frequent response I get from them ->  "get out of my class". This process went on with many teachers. All my friends started to tell me that I need to change my behaviour. So, I actually started to live with what I have. I started working at nights to actually learn something mearningful sleeping in mornings during the classes. I felt I have no better soulution that that.Some of the teachers were kind and did not punish me for sleeping during the classes. 

I started wondering if this whole educational system is working in the same way. I started reading articles about how this education system works. I found how colleges and schools go out of prescribed educational system given by govenments to their own corporate systems where they exploit students and society. 

Hope: 

When we are children, we commit lot of mistakes but sadly as we grow up, we are trained through educational system.We are trained not to commit mistakes. Doing something with lot of mistakes is not good but doing nothing with fear of committing mistakes is worst. Our present educational system is magnifying fear of commiting mistakes. We are trained to be hopeless. Due to this, many people stopped trying new things.

What is education ? 

It is just getting ready to face something which is yet to come. The problem here is that we don't know what is yet to come. Imagine a student who goes in to graduation this year. By the time they come out of graduation, it will be 2018. We don't know what might be the conditions of world in 2018, so how is it going to help ? 

Controlling our flow :

If we graduate with our college provided that there are no companies who are going to take us for placements.It only means you can become a professor at the same college. We are taught to be dependent rather than independent or interdependent. We are taught that world is limited where in contrary, science has already proved us that we are living in world of limitless possibilities. Insted of teching us how to take decisions at critical times, we are taught to follow others. 

How do we face the world which is yet to come?. How are we going to live in the world of uncertainty. Here comes our savior, the corporate world. After becoming a graduate we are becoming set of people. We are becoming set of people who don't know what we are good at and what we are really capable of. So we are sent through this controlled flow of life which finally ends with a job at a corporate giant. We go in to work or higher studies with out knowing why we are doing it. Then we do the work like we are some goats.

The reasons that you will get are : Money , Status. Those are not your's from the begin, they are adopted reasons. They are reasons which you were trained to give but you wouldn't even recognize that you were trained.
