I am a 21 year old from India. I love the idea of freedom and innovation. My major area of interest is data mining. Currently I am looking for interesting free software projects to contribute.


***What I do normally :***

I hang out with group of people with interest towards techknowlogy. 

I help run the University [tech{know}logy club](http://techknowlogy.github.io/) , in several ways.

Sessions I've helped happen: 

* Programming in python(helped with hands on session)
* [Google Summer of Code Meetup 2013](http://google-opensource.blogspot.in/2014/01/gsoc-meetup-in-coimbatore-india.html)
* Data hackathons 2014
* Software freedom day 2014
* Freshers Induction Program 2014.
* [Fedora engagement day](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Coimbatore_Fedora_Contribution_Camp)
